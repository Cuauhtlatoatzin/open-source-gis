* [Whitebox GAT Project](https://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/index.html)
* [The Generic Mapping Tools](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt)
* [Terraformer](http://terraformer.io/) &mdash; Terraformer is an open source (MIT licensed) Javascript geo toolkit, built for the server and the browser.
* [Tegola](https://tegola.io/) &mdash; An open source vector tile server written in Go, Tegola takes geospatial data and slices it into vector tiles that can be efficiently delivered to any client.
* [GeoTrellis](https://geotrellis.io/) &mdash; GeoTrellis is a geographic data processing engine for high performance applications.
* [LocationTech JTS Topology Suite](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/locationtech.jts) &mdash; The LocationTech JTS Topology Suite (JTS) is an open source Java software library that provides an object model for planar geometry together with a set of fundamental geometric functions.
* [PDAL - Point Data Abstraction Library](https://pdal.io/index.html) &mdash; PDAL is a C++ BSD library for translating and manipulating point cloud data. It is very much like the GDAL library which handles raster and vector data. 
* [GDAL - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ](https://gdal.org/) &mdash; GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.
* [GeoMesa](https://www.geomesa.org/) &mdash; Store, index, query, and transform spatio-temporal data at scale
in HBase, Accumulo, Cassandra, Kafka and Spark.
* [IstSOS](http://istsos.org/) &mdash; IstSOS is an OGC SOS server implementation written in Python.
* [Orfeo ToolBox](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/) &mdash; Orfeo ToolBox is an open-source project for state-of-the-art remote sensing, including a fast image viewer, apps callable from Bash, Python or QGIS, and a powerful C++ API. 
* [GEOS - Geometry Engine, Open Source](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos) &mdash; GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) is a C++ port of the ​JTS Topology Suite (JTS). It aims to contain the complete functionality of JTS in C++. This includes all the ​OpenGIS Simple Features for SQL spatial predicate functions and spatial operators, as well as specific JTS enhanced functions. GEOS provides spatial functionality to many other projects and products.
* [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) &mdash; GeoServer is an open source server for sharing geospatial data.
* [deegree](https://www.deegree.org/) &mdash; deegree is open source software for spatial data infrastructures and the geospatial web. deegree offers components for geospatial data management, including data access, visualization, discovery and security. Open standards are at the heart of deegree.
* [GeoMoose](https://www.geomoose.org/) &mdash; GeoMoose is a Web Client JavaScript Framework for displaying distributed cartographic data. GeoMoose has a number of strengths including modularity, configurability, and delivers a number of core functionalities in its packages. GeoMoose is also very light weight for servers making it easy to handle a large number of users, with a large number of layers, and a large number of services without stressing a server.
* [Geomajas](http://www.geomajas.org/) &mdash; Geomajas is a collection of free and open source GIS libraries, tools and API's for a complete end-to-end web mapping solution.
* [GeoTools](https://geotools.org/) &mdash; GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data.
* [MapFish](http://www.mapfish.org/) &mdash; MapFish is a flexible and complete framework for building rich web-mapping applications. It emphasizes high productivity, and high-quality development.
