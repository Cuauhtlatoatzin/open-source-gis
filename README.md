The ideal user experience (UX) allows data users to work next to EOSDIS data in the cloud, meaning that a user can simply point their analysis software to a data location in the cloud and begin analyzing without the need to transfer or download data. After completing their analyses, a user can view or download the results. An integral part of facilitating this is preprocessing these data into Analysis Ready Data (ARD), which enables end-users to begin working with data immediately."

* [MOAB — The Mesh-Oriented datABase](https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/sigma/moab-library/) &mdash; "The Mesh-Oriented datABase (MOAB) is a component for representing and evaluating mesh data. MOAB can store structured and unstructured mesh, consisting of elements in the finite element 'zoo' plus polygons and polyhedra. The functional interface to MOAB is simple yet powerful, allowing the representation of many types of metadata commonly found on the mesh. MOAB is optimized for efficiency in space and time, based on access to mesh in chunks rather than through individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual entity access. The MOAB library can naturally represent finite element and other types of mesh data [1]. Various types of meta-data are often used in conjunction with a mesh. Examples include boundary condition groupings, material types, and provenance information for the mesh. Because the data model used in MOAB is so abstract, conventions are useful for describing how meta-data is stored into that data model."
