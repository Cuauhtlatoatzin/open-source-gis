It was created to provide a visually pleasing alternative to the Gall-Peters projection, which some schools and socially concerned groups have adopted out of concern for fairness. Their priority is to show developing countries in the tropics and developed countries in the north with correctly proportioned sizes.

MOAB is optimized for efficiency in space and time, based on access to mesh in chunks rather than through individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual entity access. The MOAB library can naturally represent finite element and other types of mesh data [1]. Various types of meta-data are often used in conjunction with a mesh. Examples include boundary condition groupings, material types, and provenance information for the mesh. Because the data model used in MOAB is so abstract, conventions are useful for describing how meta-data is stored into that data model."
